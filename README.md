# Vienet Bastien - SQL Database with a form

## Explanation :

We first created a simple form in a php file with only some html written in it
Adjacent to this, we created a new database in SQL via Workench.

Our goal in this project was to link the database with the form so that, when we wrote something in the form, it was send to the database.
We also add small details with another page that just portray what's in the database.
